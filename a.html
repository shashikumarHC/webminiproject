• We have used the Ching’s Secret Veg Hakka Noodles pack but you can use any other brand of ready made noodles <br>
• Open the pack, remove the noodles from it. Break noodles slab into 2-3 pieces so that it can be easily fit into the pan. (if you want to have longer noodles, do not break the slab)<br>
• Boil 6 cups water in a large pot or a deep pan and bring it to boil over medium flame. When it comes to rolling boil, add dried noodles, 1/2 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Boil until noodles are soft, it will take around 4-5 minutes. Stir occasionally in between. <br>
• Turn off the flame and transfer it to colander to drain excess water. Pour 1-2 cups cold water over boiled noodles and drain again to remove excess stickiness.<br>
• Transfer them over to pan and toss with 1-teaspoon oil. This will prevent them from turning sticky. Transfer them to plate to make veg hakka noodles (or any other Chinese noodles). <br>
